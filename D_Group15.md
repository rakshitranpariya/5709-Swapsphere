## Testing

Briefly explain the process you went through to test your work. 

The team carefully examined the categories and their corresponding sub-categories, ensuring that they accurately displayed the items contained within them. By conducting a thorough review, they ensured that users could easily navigate through the categories, accessing the relevant sub-categories and the items associated with each. This meticulous examination guarantees that users can efficiently explore the available items, facilitating a seamless browsing experience and enabling them to find what they are looking for with ease.

The team thoroughly verified seamless navigation between the Home, Contact Us, and FAQ pages, ensuring a smooth user experience. Users can effortlessly move between these sections, accessing general information on the Home page, submitting inquiries or feedback on the Contact Us page, and finding answers to common questions on the FAQ page. This meticulous verification guarantees easy navigation and enhances overall user satisfaction.

The development team prioritized improving the user experience by meticulously refining the FAQ section. They ensured that each question directly linked to its corresponding answer, enabling users to access information quickly. Through careful organization, content verification, and user feedback consideration, the team created an intuitive interface. Users can now navigate the FAQ section effortlessly, finding answers efficiently. This demonstrates the team's commitment to providing a valuable resource and enhancing user satisfaction.

## Deployment
The development team utilized GitLab as the primary version control system for their project. GitLab provided them with powerful features for branch management, code collaboration, and version tracking. The team created different branches within GitLab to work on specific features or bug fixes separately, allowing for efficient parallel development.

Once the code changes were implemented and tested in their respective branches, the team leveraged GitLab's merge request functionality to merge the branches into a main development branch. This process facilitated thorough code reviews, discussions, and conflict resolution before finalizing the codebase.

To ensure secure code storage and seamless collaboration, the team also utilized GitHub. They uploaded their code to GitHub repositories, which served as a centralized hub for managing and organizing their project files. GitHub's user-friendly interface and collaboration features enhanced the team's ability to work together effectively.

For deployment, the team chose Netlify as their hosting platform. They used Netlify's easy-to-use deployment capabilities to make the application accessible to users. Netlify streamlined the deployment process by automatically building and deploying the code from the GitHub repositories. This integration between GitHub and Netlify enabled the team to deliver a stable and scalable application to their target audience.
